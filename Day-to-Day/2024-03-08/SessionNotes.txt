# Overloading: Not allowed in TypeScript.


# Overriding: Implementing same method in child class.

- In such cases, when we create the object of child class and call the method, then the method from child class is executed.

- If child class has not overridden the method and we create an object of child class and call the method, then the method from parent class is executed.


# Interfaces: is a contract, that class will provide the implementation of the methods which are part of the interface.
- A class implements an interface.


# Modules:
- We can export/import classes/functions in TypeScript.
- If we are exporting it from .ts file, then that becomes a module.
- We can import from this module into another file.

eg.,
> file1.ts

export class Person{

}

> file2.ts
import { Person } from ".file1.ts"

class Employee extends Person {

}
