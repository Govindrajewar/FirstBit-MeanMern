# Compilation Target version
- The current TS compiler compiles the .ts file with es5 as the default target
- We can change this to whichever version we want
> Command: tsc --target es6 index1.ts


# TypeScript Configuration:
- We can create a ts configuration file which allows us to set different properties to the ts compiler
- To create a configuration file, we use the  “-- init” option
> Command: tsc --init

* Note:
- The configuration file is “tsconfig.json”
- We can specify the source and destination folders in the tsconfig.json
> Changes done in tsconfig.json file
    1. "rootDir": "./src"           (path to get source files to compilation)
    2. "outDir": "./dest"           (path to store output files after compilation)


# Compilation of .ts file can be done in 2 ways
    1. Individual Compilation
        > Command: tsc index.ts
    Note: When we perform individual compilation, then the “tsconfig.json” file is NOT used

    2. Project Compilation
        - We do not specify any individual file
        > Command: tsc
