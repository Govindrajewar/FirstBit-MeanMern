# JavaScript Objects:
- Object contains the following:
    - Properties
    - Methods

# Objects & Classes:

- An object represents a user defined entities:
    eg., Student, Book, Employee etc.
        let Book = {
        title: "Atomic Habits",
        author: "James Clear",
        prices: 500,
        }

- We can create a simple object by assigning it with Properties & methods.
- Note: functions present inside an object are called as "methods".
- We can dynamically add Properties & methods to the object.
eg., Book.publication = "Penguin Publications";

- We can dynamically remove Properties & methods from an object.

> Remove properties from the book object:
eg., delete Book.prices;

> Remove methods from the book object:
eg., delete Book.getPrices;
