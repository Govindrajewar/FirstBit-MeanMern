# Class Selectors:
- One class can be assigned to multiple elements.
- One element can have multiple classes assigned to it.

- here we assigned one class to two different elements (p & p3).
    <p class="paragraph">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Magnam cupiditate totam iusto magni quo dignissimos sapiente qui libero, omnis laborum perferendis.
    </p>

    <p3 class="paragraph">
        This is p3 for testing purpose
    </p3>

- here we have assigned two classes using space between them.
    <div class="one paragraph">Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</div>

- The last property will apply on the element.
- depending on the declaration of classes, the properties apply on the classes.

Q: We want to apply a sty;e to the div having class as "one". This style should not get applied to the other elements.
