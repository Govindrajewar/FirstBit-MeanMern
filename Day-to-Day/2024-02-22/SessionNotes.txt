# Callback function:
- Callback functions are the functions which we do not call directly.
- We pass the callback function to a function which we are going to actually call.
- This function will then call our callback function, once its job is done.

eg 1.,
function demo(){
    console.log("Processing Complete!");
}

// setTimeout() will call our Callback function demo() after 3 seconds.
setTimeout(demo, 3000);
console.log("Hello");


eg 2.,
setTimeout( () => {
    console.log("Processing done!");
},5000);

console.log("Still Processing...");
