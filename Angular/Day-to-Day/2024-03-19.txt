# Create new component:
- When we Create a new component, Angular will Create an app component by default.
- Now when we want to generate an new app component, we can use following commands:
    -> ng generate component <component-name>
    OR:
    -> ng g c <component-name> (alias for the above command)

- If we want to use a component inside another component, we need to know which tag should be used.
- To find this tag, we should check the 'selector' value in the class file of that particular component.
- Also import the class name in '.ts' file of root component.
