# Data Binding: Data binding is a way to exchange data between our 'html' and 'ts' file.

1. Interpolation            ts    => html              {{ property/method}}
2. Event Binding            html  => ts                ( event )
3. Property Binding         ts    => html              []
4. Two Way Binding          ts   <=> html              [()]
