# Event Binding:
- To handle events that occur on the HTML page.
- We write event handlers in out .ts file.
- We bind the events to the events handlers using the () brackets.


# Property Binding:
- It allows us to assign values to the HTML properties(attributes) based on the properties/expression from our component file (.ts)
- We can use to bind various html properties like 'src', 'href', 'class'.
- So any change in the component properties will reflect dynamically on the html properties.
- Typically we will call "href" as attribute however when the DOM is created the <a> element is part of the DOM as an object, in that case we call "href" as a property.
- We use [] to bind html properties.
- Property binding is very useful when the html properties are boolean.
